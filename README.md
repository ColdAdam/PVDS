# Evaporation_Simulator
Cross sectional evaporation simulator for evaporant clouds from either thermal or e-beam evaporation and sputtering.

The evaporation simulation assumes some basic information about the vacuum system setup that allows for a straight forward approach to estimating the amount of evaporation added to the model at any particular angle. These are detailed in the theory document.
