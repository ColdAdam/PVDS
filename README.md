# Evaporation Simulator
Cross sectional evaporation simulator for evaporant clouds from either thermal or e-beam evaporation and sputtering.

The evaporation simulation assumes some basic information about the vacuum system setup that allows for a straight forward approach to estimating the amount of evaporation added to the model at any particular angle.

Current install instructions:
'''
conda activate

pip install git+https://github.com/ColdAdam/Evaporation_Simulator.git@main

python

import evapsim
'''
This will run the program.
